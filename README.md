 🎨 Java Pattern Program Project

This is a Java-based console project created as part of my BCA 2nd Year - Semester 3** coursework at Dezyne Ecole College, Ajmer.  
The project demonstrates the use of **basic Java concepts** such as:

- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Methods
- Menu-driven programming

It is designed to display various creative text patterns based on user input.
