# Java Pattern Program Project

This is a Java-based console project developed as part of my **BCA 2nd Year – Semester 3rd** coursework at Dezyne Ecole College, Ajmer.

The program demonstrates the use of basic Java concepts, including:

* Loops
* Conditional statements
* Methods
* Menu-driven programming

It generates various text-based patterns based on user input, making it a practical exercise in understanding nested loops and control structures.

---

## Features

* Menu-driven interface for easy navigation
* Accepts user input using the Scanner class
* Contains 10 different pattern programs
* Uses loops and logical conditions to produce creative shapes
* Useful for practicing Java fundamentals

---

## Patterns Included

Some of the patterns implemented in this project are:

* Right-aligned inverted triangle
* Diamond-like expanding pattern
* X-shape pattern
* Number triangle
* Number pyramid
* Number X pattern
* Hollow square with border
* Indented number-star pattern
* Alternating star and line pattern
* Repeated number-star triangle

Each pattern is built with simple nested loops and conditionals, keeping the logic easy to follow for beginners.

## Technologies Used

* Java (JDK 8 or higher)
* Scanner class for input handling
* Console-based (no GUI or frameworks)
* Single file: `PatternProgram.java`

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-pattern-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd java-pattern-project
   ```

3. Compile and run the program:

   ```bash
   javac PatternProgram.java && java PatternProgram
   ```

Ensure Java is installed and added to your system’s PATH.
